Project Google Homepage

Details:
Mini-project to deconstruct and existing web page and rebuilt it. Use the terminal and GitHub to create a repository for the lesson. Rebuild Google's homepage the best of your ability before using any dev tools. Start with the main items. First create them and then try and position them. Then the nav bar and last the footer. No peaking at others work! Use a cached google webpage. Logo is provided.

Tools:
-Git and Github
-Virtual Studio Code
	+Live Server
-Modzilla Dev tools

Outcome:
Took longer than expected since all the links and functionality don't work. Had a hard time with getting everything in the right spot. Learned a lot about flex, absolute, and relative positioning. Did not use the dev tools until near the end when I fine tuned some of the items.
